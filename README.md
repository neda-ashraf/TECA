# TECA-AI-Virtual Assistant

## Inspiration

Living in the 21st century, it has become vital to manage time and handle the day to day tasks with more ease and efficiency. With regard to the need for increased productivity , reduced working hours, flexible and accurate working model, a healthy environment, the core needs of virtual assistants do come up.

## Overview

**TECA**-An AI personal assistant is a piece of software that understands verbal or written commands and completes tasks assigned by the user. We have utilized few libraries offered by python for building this.

**TECA**, assists the user in doing the following tasks:

* Greets the user.
* Give current time ,date and day.
* Access weather updates.
* Provides information about your current location such as Longitude,Latitude and City.
* Locate your required area or place in google maps.
* Get ready access to different social media platforms like Facebook,YouTube,WhatsApp,Discord.
* Open required tab in Google chrome.
* Generate and Scan QRcode (prefer you to use saved QR code images to access it).
* Access any Website directly using the url/web address.
* Give short information or description on any particular.
* cracks jokes, sings songs if wanted and does fun stuff.

## How we built it

### python modules used in building **TECA**:

* `pip install SpeechRecognition` - covert audio in to text for the processing.
* `pip install pyttsx3`           - python library for text to speech conversion.
* `pip install playsound`         - provides Python bindings for PortAudio, the cross-platform audio I/O library.
* `pip install pywhatkit`         - python library for sending whatsapp messages, play youtube video, perform google search etc.
* `pip install webbrowser`        - allows the display of web based documents to the users.
* `pip install pyzbar`            - Python library that reads one-dimensional barcodes and QR codes using the zbar library.
* `pip install opencv-python`     - used for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.
* `pip install pyjokes`           - create random jokes.

### Made use of third party API's
*  [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api): weather forecasting.
*  [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/): identify geographical location.
